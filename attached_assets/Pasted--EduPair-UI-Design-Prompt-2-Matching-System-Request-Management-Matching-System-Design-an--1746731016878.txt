## Matching System
Design an intuitive interface for EduPair's core matching functionality that helps users find and connect with perfect learning partners based on complementary skills.

  - Each card includes:
    - User name and photo (if available)
    - Short bio (truncated with "read more" option)
    - Matching skills clearly highlighted (Your Teach → Their Learn and Your Learn → Their Teach)
    - Visual indicator showing match strength (based on number of skill overlaps)
    - "Request to Pair" button
  - Infinite scroll pagination or "Load More" button
