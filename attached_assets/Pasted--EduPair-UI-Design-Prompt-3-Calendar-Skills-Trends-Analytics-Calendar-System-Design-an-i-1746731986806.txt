# EduPair UI Design Prompt 3: Calendar, Skills Trends & Analytics

## Calendar System
Design an intuitive calendar interface that helps users manage their scheduled learning sessions effectively.

- **Month/Week/Day Toggle Views**:
  - Default to monthly view with ability to switch to week or day view
  - Clear highlighting of current date
  - Navigation controls to move between time periods
- **Session Display**:
  - Each scheduled session shown as a block in the calendar
  - Color-coded based on whether user is teaching or learning
    - Teaching sessions: #547792 (teal blue)
    - Learning sessions: #94B4C1 (soft blue)
  - Each calendar entry shows:
    - Partner's name
    - Skill focus of the session
    - Time slot (if specified)
  - Visual distinction between upcoming and past sessions
- **Session Interaction**:
  - Click/tap on session to expand details

    - Reschedule
    - Cancel
    - Add reminder
- **Empty Calendar States**:
  - Attractive placeholder for users with no scheduled sessions
  - Suggestion prompts to find matches

### 2. Session Detail View

## Skills Trends & Analytics
Design insightful analytics interfaces that show both platform-wide trends and personal statistics.

### 1. Platform Skills Trends
- **Top Skills Visualization**:
  - Bar charts showing top 5 most requested "Learn" skills
  - Bar charts showing top 5 most offered "Teach" skills
  - Use brand colors (#213448, #547792, #94B4C1, #ECEFCA) for visualization
  - Clear legends and labels
  - Time period selector (last month, 3 months, all time)
- **Trending Skills Section**:
  - Visual display of rapidly growing skills
  - Percentage increase indicators
  - Option to add trending skills to your profile

### 2. Personal Analytics Dashboard
- **User Pairing Statistics**:
  - Summary cards showing:
    - Total pairings completed
    - Number of requests sent
    - Number of requests received
    - Acceptance rate (percentage)
  - Clean visualizations for these metrics
- **Skill Engagement Breakdown**:
  - Which of your "Teach" skills are most requested
  - Which of your "Learn" skills have the most available teachers
  - Sessions completed per skill

### 3. Dark Mode Implementation
- **Comprehensive Dark Mode Support**:
  - All screens and components must have dark mode variants
  - Dark background using darker shades of #213448
  - Light text and elements using lighter variants of #ECEFCA
  - Maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility
  - Preserve brand color identity while adapting to dark palette
- **Theme Toggle**:
  - Accessible toggle in consistent location (header or settings)
  - Smooth transition animation between modes
  - Remember user preference across sessions using local storage
  - Default to system preference initially

## Responsive Considerations

  - Analytics charts resize appropriately or transform to mobile-friendly alternatives
  - Touch-friendly controls throughout
- **Mobile-Specific Features**:
